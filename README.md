# SlayOne

This is an attempt to recreate Slay.One in a desktop application, not so much as to finish the game but a milestone for me in my coding endeavours. Although my intended goal was to accomplish more than what this is now, it is still an impressive feat (for me, albeit it probably being a smol feat for you, a coding god). I'm pretty happy with the results nevertheless.

Will I be working on it again? Maybe, maybe not, but for now it's probably a no-go because I want to focus on my studies. 

First time doing github stuff so please go easy ;w;
